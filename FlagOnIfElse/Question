Question :

**Program for “Guessing Game”:
Player-1 picks a number X and Player-2 has to guess that number within N = 3 tries. For each 
wrong guess by Player-2, the program prints “Wrong, N-1 Chance(s) Left!” If Player-2 
successfully guesses the number, the program prints “Right, Player-2 wins!” and stops 
allowing further tries (if any left). Otherwise after the completion of N = 3 wrong tries, the 
program prints “Player-1 wins!” and halts.
